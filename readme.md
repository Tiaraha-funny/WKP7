# WKP7 - Library

## Structure

### This website is about creating lists of books which have been read or unread.

Who doesn't like reading a book?  ðŸ˜„

I am going to build a list of books and the user are allowed to add thier own book in the lists. In addition, they can delete anybook at anytime they want.

## 1- What I have done to code this website

- I build a html and named the class needed
- I drag the elements wich I need from the html
- I created html in my js code for setting the lists 
- I created another html to add the input that the users added
- I used *"afterend"* to set the new list just after the table header because I don't want to sroll down every time I add the list. That is easier to find the lists added.


## 2- Difficulties

I faced a lot of problems which are not solved yet till now
- Getting the checkbox works properly
- delete button doesn't delete the list which the user want to be deleted
- The input that the users added is reapeted twice in the list table
 
## 3- Things needed to improve

- I am still strugling to use the dataset and the id.

## 4- Something new

Having the local storage is still new to me but I still need some effort to it.

## 5- More explanation

I need more explanation about using dataset and the id, and also, the local storage.

## 6- Throwing error

I have got error that I couldn't solve. When I click my delete button, it throws an error. However, If I comment out the delete button function, it is gone but the delete don't work at all.

### ****Message***
I am so sorry that there are many things that are not finished in this project. I really didn't find any way to solve them. I still need some pushes from anyone especially our teacher.
**Thanks !!**
